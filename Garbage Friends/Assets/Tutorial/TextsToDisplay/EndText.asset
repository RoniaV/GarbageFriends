  sentences:
  - Brilliant, now you know how to decorate your room. Don't forget to visit the
    dumpsters on your street from time to time.
  - Now you can go do something else...
  - What?... You planned on lying around here all day?... Doing what?
  - You can move the furniture as much as you want, but don't expect it to appear
    in the dumpsters every 5 seconds.
  - I recommed you focus on another task while you wait for a new piece of furniture
    to show up.
  - Or you can leave and come back once or twice a day to rearrange your room with
    the new furniture.
  - But please, whichever way you choose... don't be foolish and don't just sit around
    waiting.
  - See you later!
