  - Well, this is getting a bit better.
  - However... it still looks a bit boring and empty... You should get some new furniture
    and decorate it to your style.
  - What did you say? ... You're bloody broke?...
  - Don't worry! You can always get furniture from the G-A-R-B-A-G-E.
  - Loads of people toss furniture they no longer need. And other people pick up
    the furniture they want.
  - Sometimes you'll find brand-new furniture, and other times you'll come across
    some crap pieces.
  - Look! They've left something in the dumpsters on your street.
